            Anchor Elements
            Wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with <a> tag

        <!--
            hyperlink reference (<href>) attribute is the destination we want our link to go to
            Absolute links: links to page on other websites on the internet
        -->
        <a  href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>

        <!--
            Relative links: links to other page within our own website
            Prepending ./ before the link will prevent unexpected issues
            By adding ./ we are specifying to our code that it should start looking for the file/dir relative to the current dir

        <!--
            Display an image in HTML using <img> element
            <img> element is self-closing, and does not need a closing tag
            Instead of wrapping content with opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using src attribute
            The src attribute works like the href attribute for anchor tags
            It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths
        -->

        <!--
            Every image element should also have an alt (alternative text) attribute
            It's used to describe an image and provide description if image can't be loaded
            It's also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impared users
